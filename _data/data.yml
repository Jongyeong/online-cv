career-profile:
    title: Research Interests
    summary: |
      I am interested in machine learning, especially the situation where the information is
      imperfect which often occurs in the real world. Until now, I have researched on Domain Adaptation,
      Crowdsourcing and corrupted labels. Recently, I also feel interested in decision making including
      Reinforcement learning.
